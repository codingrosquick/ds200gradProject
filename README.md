# Objectives & Questions to explore

Baseline analysis:
- Analyze and model the relationship between AQIs and air pollution attributable death rates, in the US and in the world.

Inference of future evolutions of health risks attributable to air pollution:
- External datasets can be used to model and predict the future evolution of air quality in different geographic zones (with NASA satellites data on air quality over time).
- Using those two models, we wish to infer the future health risks due to air pollution for specific locations in the US.

An additional related question could be studied if time permits it:
- In regards to the last GIEC (IPCC) reports, we want to determine which industries would have a negative impact on health by assessing their contribution to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants.
- We would infer their impact on health depending on the different GIEC scenarios, using the relation between health risks and AQIs drawn in the first part.
